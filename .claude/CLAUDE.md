# Fitsho - Project Instructions

## Code Style
- Only add comments for non-obvious business logic, complex algorithms, or when explaining "why" decisions were made
- Avoid obvious comments that just restate what the code does
- Keep code clean and self-documenting through clear naming
- Use `@/` path aliases for imports (e.g., `@/convex/_generated/api` not `../../../convex`)

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Convex (backend/database)
- Clerk (auth)
- Tailwind CSS

## Project
